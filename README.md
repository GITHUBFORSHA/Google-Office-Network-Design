# Google Office Network Design

## Project Overview
This project involves the creation of a Cisco Packet Tracer network simulation for a Google office. The design includes a router, switch, PCs for employees, and servers for essential services.

## Network Components
- **Router:** Cisco ISR 4221
- **Switch:** Cisco 2960
- **PCs:** 10 employee workstations
- **Servers:** 2 (file storage and email)

## Configuration Details
The network is configured with IP addressing, DHCP for automatic address assignment to PCs, and static IPs for servers. Connectivity is established using Ethernet cables, and services such as file sharing and email are set up on the servers.

## Testing Connectivity
Connectivity is tested using the `ping` command from the PCs to ensure all devices can communicate effectively.

## Project Files
The repository contains the following files:
- `Google_Office_Network_Design.pkt` - The Packet Tracer project file.

## How to Use
1. Open the `.pkt` file using Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Explore the network topology and configuration.
3. Test connectivity and modify the design as needed.
